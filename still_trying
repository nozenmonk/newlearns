I've been a vi guy for too long
tried nano
now I understand why all the freshers like nano over vi
its just a text editor like notepad 
but once you're used to vi, it kind of sticks
writing this in nano though
new learnings new experiences..guess that's how we grow

now back to vi

guess I'll be toggling
